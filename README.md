IDA-binary-patcher
==================

A little piece of software which allows applying binary patches created with IDA (File->Produce->DIF File)

The program's interface is based on a patcher from http://epicgeeks.net/ida-patcher-for-windows/ but because that patcher is no longer fully functional i've decided to write my own :)

The program is tested and working on Windows platform.
